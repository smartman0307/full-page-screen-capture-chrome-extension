Full Page Screen Capture
========================

A simple Google Chrome extension that takes a screen capture of a full web page. Every extension I tried couldn't do this on Chrome 19 on Mac OSX Lion. So, I built this one to reliably do it. (Not tested, yet, on any other configurations.)

[Install the extension](http://mrcoles.com/media/test/full-page-screen-capture-chrome-extension/full-page-screen-capture.crx)

Extra notes:

*   don't move your mouse around during the screen capture, it will cause the scroll bar to appear!
*   after intalling, you'll probably have to refresh the current tab or open a new one to immediately use the extension.
