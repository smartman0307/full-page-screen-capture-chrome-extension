Full Page Screen Capture
========================

A simple Google Chrome extension that takes a screen capture of a full web page. Every extension I tried couldn’t do this on Chrome 22 on Mac OSX Lion. So, I built this one to reliably do it. (Not tested, yet, on any other configurations.)

### To Install

From the webstore:

Find the [Full Page Screen Capture App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) in the Chrome Webstore and click install.

Or, for development:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Chrome and go to the [extensions page](chrome://chrome/extensions/)
3. Enable developer mode (if it’s not already)
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension…”
5. Select the folder for this app

### Extra notes:

*   Don’t move your mouse around during the screen capture, it will cause the scroll bar to appear!
*   Please report any bugs that you find.
